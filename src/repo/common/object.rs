/// A read-write view of data in a repository.
///
/// An `Object` is a view of data in a repository. It implements `Read`, `Write`, and `Seek` for
/// reading data from the repository and writing data to the repository.
///
/// Writing to an `Object` is transactionalâ€”writing to an object via `Write` automatically begins a
/// transaction, and calling [`commit`] completes the transaction and commits changes to the
/// repository. No data is persisted to the repository until the transaction is committed.
/// Changes made to this object are not visible to other `Object` or `ReadOnlyObject` instances
/// until the transaction is complete. When an `Object` is dropped, any bytes written since the last
/// commit are discarded.
///
/// Attempting to read or seek on an `Object` with uncommitted changes will always return
/// [`Error::TransactionInProgress`]. Attempting to write to an `Object` if another `Object`
/// instance already has a transaction in progress will also return
/// [`Error::TransactionInProgress`].
///
/// Because `Object` internally buffers data when reading, there's no need to use a buffered reader
/// like `BufReader`.
///
/// If encryption is enabled for the repository, data integrity is automatically verified as it is
/// read and methods will return an `Err` if corrupt data is found. The [`verify`] method can be
/// used to check the integrity of all the data in the object whether encryption is enabled or not.
///
/// The methods of `Read`, `Write`, and `Seek` return `io::Result`, but the returned `io::Error` can
/// be converted `Into` an `acid_store::Error` to be consistent with the rest of the library.
