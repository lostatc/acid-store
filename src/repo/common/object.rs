/// A read-write view of data in a repository.
///
/// An `Object` is a view of data in a repository. It implements `Read`, `Write`, and `Seek` for
/// reading data from the repository and writing data to the repository.
///
/// Writing to an `Object` is transactionalâ€”writing to an object via `Write` automatically begins a
/// transaction, and calling [`commit`] completes the transaction and commits changes to the
/// repository. No data is persisted to the repository until the transaction is committed. When an
/// `Object` is dropped, any uncommitted changes are discarded. Attempting to read or seek on an
/// `Object` with uncommitted changes will return [`Error::TransactionInProgress`].
///
/// It is possible to have multiple `Object` and [`ReadOnlyObject`] instances which all refer to the
/// same object. Different instances can all read from the object concurrently, but only one
/// instance can have a transaction in progress. Attempting to write to an `Object` if another
/// instance already has a transaction in progress will return [`Error::TransactionInProgress`].
/// Additionally, changes to an object are not visible to other instances until the transaction is
/// committed.
///
/// Because `Object` internally buffers data when reading, there's no need to use a buffered reader
/// like `BufReader`.
///
/// If encryption is enabled for the repository, data integrity is automatically verified as it is
/// read and methods will return an [`Error::InvalidData`] if corrupt data is found. The [`verify`]
/// method can be used to check the integrity of all the data in the object whether encryption is
/// enabled or not.
///
/// The methods of `Read`, `Write`, and `Seek` return `io::Result`, but the returned `io::Error` can
/// be converted `Into` a [`crate::Error`] to be consistent with the rest of the library.
